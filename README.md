# TokenTalk
## A Social, swap-based  NFT Marketplace

## The problem it solves

The two major problems that were tried to solve here -

1.  The current NFT marketplace lacks a social touch to it. Currently, the users relay on Twitter/Reddit to connect with owners of NFTs of their interest. 

- Imagine a real-life collectible like a sneaker that gets traded/swapped with others in a social exchange that involves negotiations. how cool would that be to connect with people directly who own NFTs of your interest?

- Social connectivity can help NFT collectors to connect with each other, share their collections, and engage in discussions about the NFT space. This can create a sense of community among collectors, making the NFT ecosystem more engaging and vibrant.

2. The current NFT marketplaces are built around trading NFTs and holding these NFTs in a third-party intermediary or escrow service.
TokenTalk enables the NFT trades without, taking custody of NFTs into any escrow accounts.
Swappable NFT marketplaces can help to promote price discovery and liquidity in the NFT market.
